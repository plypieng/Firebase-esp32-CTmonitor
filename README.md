# Firebase-esp32-CTmonitor
My own version of CT monitoring using esp32 to Firebase realtimedatabase with webapp

Thanks the code from https://github.com/RuiSantosdotme/Firebase-ESP32-ESP8266-eBook

Which I modified it to work with CT-clamp sensor U-rd CTL-16 instead of DHT11

Need firebase account with realtimedatabase to act as a data storage and  webapp host
